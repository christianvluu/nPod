# Welcome to nPod!
Networked Passive-Infrared Occupancy Detector (nPod)

## Introduction to the Creators
(Updated May 29, 2019)

Hello! We are Christian Luu '19 and Nick Healy '20, students at The Lawrenceville School, NJ. As high schoolers with a passion for technology, we are constantly striving to improve our local community with our knowledge. We both believe in project-based learning and nPod here is one of many projects we've been involved in (others include autonomous miniature cars with pixy cameras, miniature robotic arm with Leap Motion, robotics, computer vision for robotics, etc.). With nPod, we are solving a problem that is not only specific to Lawrenceville but also applicable to many other schools and collaborative spaces alike; that is why we are making nPod an open-sourced project.

## Introduction to nPod
(Updated April 27th, 2019)
Have you ever had the problem of not being able to find a collaborative space in your library or other academic buildings? Especially during final exams week? You walk all the way from your dorm to find out that every room has been taken?

Introducing nPod! nPod is an IoT device based on the Arduino MKR1010 microcontroller. The device has a small passive infrared (PIR) sensor similar to those found in motion activated lights. This sensor provides data on whether or not people (alive and moving) are in the vicinity of the device. Users are able to login or visit a website to view the status of collaborative spaces so they can plan their time accordingly. Furthermore, they will also be able to 'informally' reserve the room when the reservation is in the same day.
