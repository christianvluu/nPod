# Welcome to nPod!
Networked Passive-Infrared Occupancy Detector (nPod)
## Introduction to the Creators
(Updated April 18th, 2019)

Hello! We are Christian Luu '19 and Nick Healy '20, students at The Lawrenceville School, NJ. As high schoolers with a passion for technology, we are constantly striving to improve our local community with our knowledge. We both believe in project-based learning and nPod here is one of many projects we've been involved in (others include autnomous miniature cars with pixy cameras, miniature robotic arm with Leap Motion, robotics, computer vision for robotics, etc.). With nPod, we are solving a problem that is not only specific to Lawrenceville but also applicable to many other schools and collaborative spaces alike; that is why we are making nPod an open-sourced project.
